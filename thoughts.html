        <h2>GOOD MORNING</h2>
        <p>I read somewhere that the human brain has an average of 50,000 thoughts in a day. Here’s a thought, what if we could get a list of these thoughts in the mail the next day?</p>
        <p>I don’t believe that just happened! I am never going to forgive Shakira for leaving me in the hot air balloon again.

            Dream. Oh.
            
            Did I set my alarm for this early? I am pretty sure that was a mistake.
            
            I can skip showering for a day right?
            
            How late is late late?
            
            Brushing is so weird. It’s like brushing your teeth. Wait. What.
            
            Did I turn the fan in my room off? Must turn it off before mamma wakes up and turns it off. I wake up before my mother. How adult am I.
            
            Pimple.
            
            What song is this.
            
            I don’t even know why I buy clothes when I know I am going to wear the same blue jeans and black tee everyday.
            
            Chai must be boiling.
            
            Its hot today.
            
            Where is the strainer?
            
            Don’t forget to call that cousin you don’t like. It’s her birthday...</p>
            <p>Blow-dry or flat iron?

                Wasn’t a movie going to release today? What page was I on? Where is my bookmark. I am pretty sure I used a bookmark. Page 234. Damn it. That was from yesterday.
                
                I’ll wear the yellow tee today.
                
                I should have said – “no. because then that would make me like you” haha! BURN! Should’ve had this thought yesterday.
                
                Hair fall is a real thing. Must be the monsoons. Hair is sticking out of unimaginable places. Its January.
                
                Ouu. Tingles. Haha.
                
                Forgot to turn the charger on again last night. Good job,P.
                
                Aaargh! My toe!!! Everyday!
                
                Can’t find the second earring. Maybe I won’t wear earrings at all.
                
                Mohabbat karle karle re. Mohabbat karle re.
                
                Shit forgot my keys. Old age is approaching.
                
                Shut up.
                
                Mohabbat karle karle re. mohabbat karle re. Mohabbat karle karle re. mohabbat karle re.
                
                Mohabbat karle karle re. mohabbat karle re. Mohabbat karle karle re. mohabbat karle re.
                
                If I find my green hairtie in the back seat of my car, I wont get traffic today.
                
                Damn it.</p>
            <p>
                Don’t forget to call that cousin you don’t like. Its her birthday. Please!
                
                I’ve been stuck here forever. Are the wheels even making one full rotation on the road?
                
                Oh, happy ‘worst-songs-on-radio’ day, everybody!
                
                How do I constantly have a back ache? Is ache spelled a..c..h..e.. or a..c..e..
                
                That’s ace.
                
                How can I forget the spelling of a word so simple.
                
                Ache. Ache.
                
                Now I’ve said it so many times, it doesn’t make sense as a word anymore.
                
                Mohabbat karle karle re. mohabbat karle re. Mohabbat…</p>
                <p>

                    Ouu. Looks like the caffeine from my tea is just hitting. Should have worn the maroon tee.
                    
                    Sweat is basically your armpits crying tears of suffocation and heat.
                    
                    Forgot to wear my watch again.
                    
                    Call cousin! Don’t forget! Birthday!
                    
                    I hope something surprising happens today. Like I get money. Or a gift. Or something free.
                    
                    Did I forget to get the lunch Maa packed for me! Shit!
                    
                    Oh no wait I am holding it right now.
                    
                    Its so weird to type on the keyboard when you take the protective cover off. Haha smooth.
                    
                    What is this itch on my wrist? Did something bite me again? Or is it an internal infection.
                    
                    Must google.. ‘Reasons to amputate hand’.
                    
                    Where the heck did I keep my lip balm?
                    
                    How can I lose my glasses everyday. Everyday.
                    
                    Oh wait. I am wearing them.
                    
                    Is it true that the pyramids were actually built by aliens?
                    
                    Mohabbat karle karle re. mohabbat karle re.
                    
                    WHY IS THIS SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD!
                    
                    Don’t forget to call that cousin you don’t like..
                    
                    Maybe after lunch.</p>
                    <p>
                        This back ache is annoying. Back a..c…h…e..
                        
                        Maybe I’ll finish work before time today and then go home and read my book.
                        
                        Or should I meet my friends instead. Maybe I’ll just read.
                        
                        Should I talk to someone about this itch? I think it has spread to my fingers. And my toes.
                        
                        Even the back of my head is itching. What the hell!
                        
                        I should’ve said – “At least I am not a high beam driver like you!!” nahh.
                        
                        Wish Cousin you don’t like! Ayushi. Call. Call. Call.
                        
                        Maybe I’ll have chai first.
                        
                        Did I wash my hair yesterday? Or the day before?
                        
                        As long as it doesn’t stink, I guess.
                        
                        What’s that smell??
                        
                        Am I chewing too loudly?
                        
                        Have to call the cousin I don’t like as soon as I am done eating.
                        
                        How has everyone left already? Its boiling outside. Hate monsoons. Wait. What.
                        
                        Traffic is going to be crazy.
                        
                        Cray cray.
                        
                        Yuck.
                        
                        I need a massage!
                        
                        Staring at my phone makes me dizzy.
                        
                        Haha. Puppy videos.
                        
                        I’ve spent more than an hour on Instagram today? its not like that’s bad, right?
                        
                        That’s bad. I am going to reduce my screen time.
                        
                        More books. Less screen.
                        
                        Must share this meme with the girls.
                        
                        You didn’t call that cousin you don’t like!!! Do it in the car right now!
                        
                        Staring at my phone makes me dizzy.
                        
                        How many days are there in this month? This knuckle technique is flawless, haan.
                        
                        I feel like I am born to spend my life stuck in traffic jams.
                        
                        Where’s my charger?
                        
                        Shit I left my lunchbox on my desk.
                        
                        Don’t feel like dinner. Maybe a glass of milk. And chocolates. My pyjamas don’t match.
                        
                        I am balding. Effectively.
                        
                        Ahhhh. My back! Heeeeehhhghh.
                        
                        Does everyone make weird stretching noises?
                        
                        Alarm is set. Day was happy. Life is great. Good night world.</p>
